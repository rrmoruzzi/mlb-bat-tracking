    "## Data scrapping Baseball savant data\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseball savant provides data for many aspects of baseball, including batting, pitching, fielding. In this notebook we are scrapping the data from the website, though a user can download a .csv file from the website. One advantage of scrapping the data is that we can get every column of data into a file, while on the website, a user can give selections of data they want. I note below where this code can be adapted to include certain years and selections."
